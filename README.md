# Depression-Detection-Using-Text-Samples

## Overview 🧐

This GitHub project is dedicated to detecting depression in text samples using the Daic Woz dataset. The dataset comprises transcripts of audio recordings where individuals discuss various topics, with some diagnosed with depression. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this project aims to develop a model capable of identifying signs of depression based on textual data.

## Dataset 📊

The Daic Woz dataset serves as the cornerstone for training and evaluating the depression detection model. This dataset contains transcriptions of spoken interactions between individuals and a computer system, encompassing both depressed and non-depressed individuals. For more details about the dataset, please refer to the [Daic Woz dataset documentation](link-to-dataset-documentation).

## Dependencies 🛠️

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running and exploring the code interactively)


## Usage 🚀

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/depression-detection.git
cd depression-detection
```

2. Download the Daic Woz dataset from the [Daic Woz website](link-to-dataset-website) and place it in the `data` directory.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Final_Detecting_Depression.ipynb
```

This interactive notebook contains code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each cell.

## Results 📈

Explore the notebook to view the model's performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Visualizations such as confusion matrices and relevant plots are included to enhance result comprehension.

## Note 📝

**Dataset Availability**: Due to its size, the Daic Woz dataset is not included in this repository. Please download it directly from the [Daic Woz website](link-to-dataset-website).
